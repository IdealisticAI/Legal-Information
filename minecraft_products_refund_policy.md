## SpigotMC Platform:
SpigotMC is not a sales platform but a forum community. They offer a Premium Resources section with strict rules as a way for users/members to contribute to developers who’s projects require financial support. Still, the main focus is on the free resources and forums. Other platforms such as BuiltByBit and Polymart do offer a handy amount of seller tools and thus make it clear that their intentions are for users/members to use their platform to practice sales. For this reason, unless deemed absolutely necessary, a refund for SpigotMC purchases is not offered.

## Time Limitations:
```
1. Refund requests beyond exactly 120 hours of the purchase date are not eligible, unless we decide to exempt this term.
```
```
2. Refund requests which have been unfulfilled due to the customer’s fault expire 48 hours after their request date. New ones can be submitted based on the new date & information.
```
```
3. Mistaken purchases in the Polymart platform are eligible for a refund within the first 24 hours of purchase.
```

## Justification Limitations:
```
1. No refunds unless the product doesn’t work as described and we fail to provide a fix when contacted.
```
```
2. Suspended licenses, services, extensions/additions or subscriptions are not refundable.
```

## Amount Limitations:
1. Transaction, exchange or other fees may not be included in refunds, which will result in lower amounts compared to the originally paid.

## Post Refund Period:
1. Following a successful refund, your license along with its associated products may be terminated, and you may be disallowed from temporarily/permanently purchasing the same product and/or its associated products.
