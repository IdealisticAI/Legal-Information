## Terms of Use
* You are responsible for the security of your account. You must use a valid email address and a strong password if required. In case you lose access to both your email address and password, we do not guarantee restoring your account or its contents in any way or form.

* You are responsible for reporting system problems you find. Not reporting a problem is not a punishable offense, but exploiting or sharing it is.
* Transferring, selling or distributing your account or its contents is not allowed.
* You are responsible for the contents you download from us and their distribution.
* Creating more than one account is not allowed, with the exemption of having paused/deleted your previous one, or having been granted permission by an administrator of ours, in which case we recommend recording evidence of the matter for your own coverage.
* Distribution of our content is subject to these terms and their respective own terms if existent. You are required to follow these terms or cease use of our content.
* We do not guarantee the availability of our support for matters not of our own. As for matters of our own, we reserve the right to delay or exit them at any moment in time, for any duration, without notification.

* We are not liable for any damage our system may cause to you or your services.
* We do not guarantee the constant uptime or delay-free practice of our system as any system is prone to going through moments of disruption.

## Data Collection
* We do not distribute private information in any way with the exception of potentially showcasing some of it in certain parts of our applications for when you are logged in.
* We collect private information such as your email-address/es, phone-number/s, ip-address/es and browser user-agent/s, and use it to protect the platform from suspicious behavior, identify you and implement functionalities.
* Passwords are one-way encrypted, meaning we cannot know or retrieve the exact text you inserted without improbable or unimaginably time-consuming calculations.
* We may use cookies, which are files locally stored in your browser, to identify your account and thus offer you further access to our system in the form of an application. Such a capability requires us to store previously documented information to one or multiple unique identifier/s to ensure it is you who is the original user.
